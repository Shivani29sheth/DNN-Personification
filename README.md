This above GIF representing the training ouputs that were produced when StyleGAN model was trained on the celebrity HQ dataset on GoogleCOLAB. The training time was nearly 3 days with possible interruptions and reloading of the saved models. The snapshot of evaluated model has been included below. This training was done on GoogleCOLAB Pro version, by using Tesla P100-PCIE-16GB GPU, with 25.51 GB of usable RAM and 147.15 GB of usable Memory.

The training of the StyleGAN model was done in batches where 6 batches of roughly 12 hrs training was divided and the training was resumed from the point the previous batch left. This led in using the StyleGAN model for our Local GAN editing project. The snapshot of the training example is attached below.
